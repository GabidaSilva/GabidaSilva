- 👋 Hi, I’m @GabidaSilva.
- 👀 I’m interested in in Front-end, Back-end and Full Stack programming.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning front-end. I intend to complete the Proz Educacao Talent Cloud course by the end of the year and complete the Alura ONE course by April 2025.
I also want to learn English.
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on front-end developments, mainly through voluntary work, since I am new to technology.
